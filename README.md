# guppy
code/data associated with guppy fitness analysis for Fitzpatrick et al.

'guppy_glmm_040218.R' runs through the analyses of lifetime reproductive success (LRS) in Taylor and Caigual streams
'guppy_glmm_longevity_040218_merged.R' contains analyses of longevity in both streams

Both analyses start by accessing the original data for this project, which can be found in file 'FocalFish_fitness.csv'

This analysis required extensive simulations to compute confidence intervals/bands; intermediate output from these analyses can be found in the 'data' folder, to avoid the need to re-run days worth of calculations. These intermediate files are referenced in the analysis scripts.
